# countdown_codes

There are two notebooks included here.  Both of these are in relation to countdown - they use the https://wiki.apterous.org/Main_Page website which contains logs of Countdown shows.  I can generate either a random round (using one Notebook) or random Tea Time Teaser (using the other Notebook).  This is relatively self explanatory.

Let me know if you have any suggestions for improvements!
